### Useful K8s Yamls
This folder contains a few sub folders.  
**diag** has useful yamls particularly crafted to debug K8s nodes and pods (mostly at OS level).  
**examples** contains application deployments.  
**templates** are reusable yamls for basic K8s objects, where you need to modify and replace values before use.
